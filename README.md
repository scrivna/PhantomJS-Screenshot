# PhantomJS - Desktop & Mobile Screenshot
This was based on the example rasterize.js file phantomjs provides, but PhantomJS has some functionality that can hinder trying to take a screenshot, this is my evolving configuration file to get good results in a reasonable timeframe.

My own personal usage requires 2 sizes, a desktop & mobile view at certain sizes, so I have an argument for that. YMMV

## Usage
> phantomjs screenshot.js "URL" filename.png (desktop|mobile)
