# PhantomJS - Desktop & Mobile Screenshot
Script to (more reliably) take a Desktop or Mobile screenshot with PhantomJS

PhantomJS has some functionality that can hinder trying to take a screenshot, this is my evolving configuration file to get good results in a reasonable timeframe.

## Usage
$> phantomjs screenshot.js "URL" filename.png (desktop|mobile)
